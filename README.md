### Coreboot Configuration

To run macOS smoothly on the Asus Chromebox 3, it is recommended to replace the stock firmware with Coreboot. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Install and Configure MrChromebox Coreboot**:
    - Follow the instructions on [MrChromebox.tech](https://mrchromebox.tech) to flash Coreboot firmware.
    - Ensure the firmware is configured to allow UEFI boot mode.

2. **Bootloader Setup**:
    - Use OpenCore as the bootloader. The EFI folder provided in this repository is already configured for optimal compatibility with macOS Sonoma.

3. **Disable Write Protection**:
    - Before flashing, you may need to disable write protection by removing the WP screw on the motherboard.

4. **Update Firmware**:
    - Use the MrChromebox script to install the UEFI firmware. This will replace the factory BIOS with Coreboot.

### Installation

1. **Prepare macOS USB Installer**: Create a macOS Sonoma 14.6.1 installer using [macOS Recovery](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372) or from a working macOS environment.

2. **Copy EFI Folder**: After creating the USB installer, replace the EFI folder on the USB drive with the one from this repository.

3. **Boot the Installer**: Boot from the USB installer and follow the standard macOS installation steps.

4. **Post-Installation**:
    - Copy the contents of EFI-Boot folder from the repo to the USB's EFI parition.
    - Once the system boots and the setup is done, mount the system's EFI partition and copy the  to your system's EFI partition after installing macOS.
    - Generate your own SMBIOS using [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) and replace the `SerialNumber`, `BoardSerialNumber`, and `SmUUID` in `config.plist`.

### Setting Up Intel 7265 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

1. Download the latest release of [AirportItlwm](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm).
2. Add `AirportItlwm.kext` to your EFI's `OC/Kexts` folder and update your `config.plist` to include the kext.
3. The native macOS Wi-Fi menu will now work with your Intel 7265, no need for HeliPort.

### Known Issues & Troubleshooting

- **Wake from Sleep Issues**: If the system does not wake from sleep properly, try adjusting the `Darkwake` settings in `config.plist`.
- **Intel Wi-Fi Configuration**: For Intel 7265, follow the instructions from the [OpenIntelWireless](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm) project to set up Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Note that advanced features like AirDrop and Handoff are not supported.
